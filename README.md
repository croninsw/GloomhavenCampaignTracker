# Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker

## Our Intent
As a side project to keep up our coding skills, Brian Neal and I (Sam Cronin) have got together to build an application for our consumption only. Gloomhaven Campaign Tracker (working title) serves to provide necessary pieces of information relevant to us and those we play the game with.

## The Game
[Gloomhaven](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven) is a strategic, tactical combat game with Euro-inspired card play. In Gloomhaven, players will fight monsters, accrue wealth with which they can buy gear and donate to fund the city, and increase their personal stats within their party. 

To that end, there are a lot of tiny moving parts and pieces of information that players must maintain. In our application, we hope to mitigate some of the stress that comes along with the game as well store information in one place.
